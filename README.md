# Telecom-Customer-Churn-Analysis

# 1. Overview: What is Customer Churn and Why It Matters

Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a company‚Äôs product or service within a given time period. In highly competitive industries like telecommunications, churn has a direct and significant impact on revenue and customer lifetime value.

Understanding why customers churn helps businesses reduce losses, improve customer satisfaction, and design strategies to increase retention. Churn analysis provides actionable insights that help companies retain valuable customers and reduce acquisition costs.

# 2. Project Objective

The main objective of this project is to analyze customer behavior and service usage patterns to identify the key factors behind churn in a telecom company. By visualizing and interpreting customer data, the goal is to:

* Detect high-risk customer segments

* Evaluate the impact of services and contracts on churn

* Provide business-driven recommendations to reduce churn rate

* Support data-driven decision-making to improve customer loyalty

# 3. Tools Used
üêç Python: Used for initial data cleaning and preparation

üìä Tableau: Used for building interactive dashboards and extracting meaningful insights through powerful data visualizations

# 4. Work Done in Tableau

The analysis was divided into three main dashboards:

üî∑ a. Overview Dashboard

Purpose: To provide a high-level summary of churned vs retained customers, contract types, internet services, and payment methods.
Key Insight:

85% of churned customers were on month-to-month contracts

Most churned customers used Fiber Optic and Electronic Check payment methods

Churned customers represent a 30% monthly revenue loss

üî∑ b. Service Usage & Churn Behavior Dashboard

Purpose: To explore the relationship between churn and services used, like tech support, online security, device protection, etc.
Key Insights:

78% of churned customers didn't use online security

77% didn't have tech support

91% of churned customers had phone service (a potential issue point)

Paperless billing was used by 75% of churned customers

This dashboard helped segment service usage into:

Services not used (indicating low engagement)

Services used but associated with dissatisfaction

üî∑ c. Customer Demographics Dashboard
Purpose: To examine churn patterns based on gender, age, dependents, and partnership status
Key Insights:

42% of churned customers are senior citizens

83% of churned customers had no dependents

Customers without partners were more likely to churn

This demographic insight is valuable for targeted engagement campaigns.

# 5. Business Recommendations

Based on the insights, the following actions are recommended:

Improve Retention Strategies for month-to-month contract users

Promote Optional Services like tech support and online security

Reassess Phone Service Quality due to high churn among users

Optimize Paperless Billing Experience

Target High-Risk Segments with loyalty offers

Focus on Vulnerable Demographics (senior citizens, single customers)

# 6. Business Impact Forecast (Impact Analysis)

If the above recommendations are implemented, we estimate:

Churn rate can drop by 15‚Äì20%, especially among high-risk customers using month-to-month contracts and not subscribed to optional services

This reduction could recover over $400K in monthly revenue

Enhancing retention even slightly (by 5%) can increase profitability by 25‚Äì30%, based on telecom industry benchmarks

# 7. Conclusion

This project demonstrates how effective data analysis and visualization can uncover hidden patterns in customer behavior. By identifying churn drivers and segmenting at-risk customers, telecom companies can shift from reactive to proactive strategies.
Implementing these insights can significantly improve customer lifetime value, reduce churn, and support sustainable growth.
